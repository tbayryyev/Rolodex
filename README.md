# Rolodex
A program written in Java that implements a **_Rolodex_**. The implementation of a **_Rolodex_** is based on a double linked-list. Each node in the list
is called an entry. Each entry will have a reference to the next entry and to the previous entry. An entry may either be a separator or a card. The program is organized into four Java classes: Rolodex (main class), Entry (abstract class), Card (subclass of Entry), and Seperator (subclass of Entry).
